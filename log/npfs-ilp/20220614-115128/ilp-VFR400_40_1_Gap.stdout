Elapsed ordering time = 5s
Elapsed ordering time = 10s
Ordering time: 2297.22s

Barrier performed 0 iterations in 2974.41 seconds (318.58 work units)
Barrier solve interrupted - model solved by another algorithm

Concurrent spin time: 2306.02s (can be avoided by choosing Method=3)

Solved with dual simplex
